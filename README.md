To run the application, you'll need Node.js installed on your computer. You should install it from nodejs.org.
Once you've done that, open up the terminal and enter: 
	npm install electron --save-dev
This should install the necessary packages to run the app. Once this process is complete, enter: 
	npm start
and the app should be up and running! Let me know if you encounter any errors.
