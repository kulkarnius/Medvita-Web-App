Download VScode. Install the Live Server Extension. Right click the index.html file and open with Live Server. Upon opening with Live Server it should open up in your default browser.

If you are a fancy person, then I would download Node.js and then run

npm install -g firebase-tools

And then login into firebase using the command line.
Then run,

firebase init

Follow the instructions as necessary to make it work. After following the instructions run:

firebase serve

This will localhost the website and should serve it normally.

To deploy, follow the same process but run 

firebase deploy 

at the end of it instead.
